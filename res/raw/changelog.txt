  ! Welcome to Change Log Test App! Here is the list of features:
    # Enter your change log in a very simple way
    # Customize appearance of change logs with CSS
    # Don't care about version number handling
  ! How to enter the change log:
    * Use text file res/raw/changelog.txt
    * First input your HTML until the body-Tag. Here you can enter CSS for div.title, div.subtitle, div.freetext and div.list (see below) and any other elements you should be using, e.g. links.
    * To begin a section for any version start the line with a dollar sign followed by the version number.
    * %25 begins a line of a version section title.
    * _ begins a line of a version section subtitle.
    * ! begins a line of free text.
    * # begins a line within a numbered list.
    * * begins a line within a bullet list.
    * Lines beginning without any of these signs will be output as they are.
    * You can use HTML anywhere you want.
    * After the last version section insert a line containing "$ END_OF_CHANGE_LOG".
    * After that you should enter HTML again, at least the end-body-tag and the end-html-tag.
  ! How handle versions:
    * Just put a String named "version" in values/string.xml with the version number of you app and keep it updated.
    * Be sure to have a section with this version number in changelog.txt (e.g. "$ 1.0").
    * That's all!
  ! Put these string into string.xml also:
    * "full_change_log_title" - Dialog title when displaying a full change log
    * "whats_new_title" - Dialog title when displaying only the new features of your app
    * "change_log_ok_button" - text on the OK-button of the change log dialog
  ! Using Change Log in code:
    * First instantiate ChangeLog from within an Activity: ChangeLog cl = new ChangeLog(this);
    * cl.firstRun() tells you whether your app is called the first time since first installation or installation of a new version.
    * cl.getLogDialog() returns a Dialog displaying the new features of your app.
    * cl.getFullLogDialog() returns a Dialog with the complete change log.
